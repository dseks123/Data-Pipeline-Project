# First Data Pipeline Project Readme
Establishing real_time interaction with a database to analyze flight delay data
This project is using a kaggle dataset of delayed flight-data around US Airports for the year 2015.
The purpose of this project is to analyze delayed flight-date in real-time via a streamlit app in order to answer questions like:
- What airlines had the worst/longest delays? What were these delays attributed to?
- Which months of the year had the worst/least delays? Any explanations? why?
- Any explanations why?
- Which airport had the most notorious departure delays? What are/were the major factors contributing to the delays at major airportnt data?
- Based on the data available, what it the likelihood of flight delay by a given airline - or airport? What would the most likely reason be - and what does this say about the reliability of the airport / airline (or the lack thereof)?
-
