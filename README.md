Establishing real_time interaction with a database to analyze flight delay data
This project is using a kaggle dataset of delayed flight-data around US Airports from the year 2015.
The purpose of this project is to analyze delayed flight-date in real-time via a streamlit app in order to answer questions like:
- Which airport had the most notorious departure delays?
- Can we projecct departure delay for a given route based on the data in our dataset? How does that prediction compare with current data?
- Flight delay is always an overhead. Which airline was affected the most? On which route? Can we possibly identify the reason for the delay?
- Based on the data available, what it the likelihood of flight cancallation by a give airline? What would the most likely reason be - and what does this say about the reliability of the airline (or the lack thereof)?
